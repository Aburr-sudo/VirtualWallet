1. When viewing reciepts, if the a category has a value of 0 it should not be displayed. 
This will clean up the user interface and make it much easier to read


2. Add option to specify the purchase, or to leave it as a generic purchase of the category type
eg. Groceries: fruit, cleaning products ; Entertainment: Movie tickets
or Groceries: 2 items ; Entertainment: 1 item

This will allow a more detailed view of purchase history and allow the more fine grained stat analsysis of trends
